## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Marcos and I am currently working as a medior software engineer at Capgemini. I've been working with .NET Framework and Core since 2020, from microservices to cloud-native applications in AWS. I also have some experience working in CI/CD environments, building pipelines and IaC. The sectors that I've worked for include healthcare and logistics/industrial. 

Currently, I keep improving my skills and learning new technologies. I'm currently learning Rust to keep my low-level code on check, and I'm studying to adquire AWS certifications. 

My GitHub doesn't contain much of my code since I don't work on open-source projects, so it's mostly me fooling around with stuff that interests me. Expect to find lots of stuff to laugh at though!
